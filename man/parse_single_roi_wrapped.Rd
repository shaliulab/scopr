  min_time = 0,
  max_time = +Inf,
  reference_hour = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{id}{character, unique to the animal to be loaded}

\item{region_id}{numeric, position of the animal's roi in the ethoscope's layout. Should be 1-20 for the standard 20-animal arena}

\item{path}{character, absolue path to dbfile (sqlite)}

\item{min_time}{numeric, time in seconds from the start of the experiment after which the data is loaded into R}

\item{max_time}{numeric, time in seconds from the start of the experiment after which the data is not loaded into R}

\item{reference_hour}{integer, hour of the day in GMT TZ when the incubator turned the light on. If the reference hour did not happen yet on the loading day,
a whole extra day is prepended to the data, because the time series always starts with an L phase (even if this L phase is fully NA)}

\item{columns}{Columns to be loaded from the dbfile. Checked against the VAR_MAP for availability}

\item{file_size}{Size of dbfile to be loaded in bytes}

\item{verbose}{Whether to report progress or not (via console)}

\item{FUN, }{function or list, a function or list of functions that processes the data loaded from the SQLite file in some meaningful way}

\item{updateProgress_load}{Function to call when a new animal is loaded successfully from the sqlite database}

\item{updateProgress_annotate}{Function to call when a new animal is processed successfully}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the passed FUN}
}
\description{
Loading is done by read_single_roi. Annotation is done by annotate_single_roi
}
